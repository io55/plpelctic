A Telegram bot developed by intns for use in internal IO55 chatrooms

## Setup
- Create a file named `secret.txt` in the same directory as the executable and put your Telegram bot token inside.
- Place your word listed pads in a folder named "listopad" in the same directory as the executable, the bot accepts any filename, as long as it is inside the given folder.

## To-do
- Refactor most of the code into a more maintainable setup.
- Reimplement Telegram bot implementation, as it is now outdated and is to become obsolete according to the lib's standards.
